This project leverages OpenCV in Python to create a movement detection system that captures video through a camera feed and detects motion in real-time. By analyzing the difference between the current frame and a baseline frame, the system identifies movement and draws bounding boxes around detected areas. It logs the start and end timestamps of each detected motion event, saving them in a CSV file for easy analysis. This solution can be applied in basic surveillance, monitoring applications, and other automation tasks requiring motion detection.
